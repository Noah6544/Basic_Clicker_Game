# Development
## Version 2:
- ## Work on basic core functionality before scaling the game up
- Fix the bug that the CPS button doesn't display.
  - Once this is fixed I can mass scale the game up easily using the streamlined function system
### Future ideas:
- Add an achievement system for:
     - Number of clicks.
    - Number of money eared
- Add a file saving sysem which will hold all object data for next game session.
- Create images for the game to make it cleaner to look at.
