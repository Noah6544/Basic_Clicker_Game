# Basic_Clicker_Game
## Purpose:
- Working on learning Tkinter and implementing it with a clicker game project
- Work on some problem solving, such as a passive CPS that will increase every second but with time.sleep() it won't work as intended.
- Finally have something decent that my friends can relate to and appreciate
## ToDo
- Work on the Newupgrade function to streamline the upgrade creation process
- Passively increase money every second without stopping the entire system
